^ 100,000s of users building the best iOS and Mac apps
^ Important b/c it allows the community to share code and focus on whatever it is they do best

# Releases
## [fit] 0.34.0.rc1, 0.34.0, 0.34.1, 0.34.2, 0.34.4

^ Special thanks to Fabio, Alloy and Kyle and the rest of the Core team for making these releases possible (and doing most of the hard work)

# _**Molinillo**_
## [fit] Dependency Resolution Gem

---

### But first, a detour

---

## The *Podspec*

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name     = 'PromiseKit-AFNetworking'
  s.version  = '0.1.4' 
  s.dependency 'AFNetworking', '~> 2.0'
  s.dependency 'PromiseKit/Promise'
end
```

---

## The *Podfile*

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs'
platform, :ios, '8.1'
pod 'AFNetworking', '< 1.3'
pod 'RestKit', '~> 0.23.0'
pod 'SEGModules', git: 'https://github.com/segiddins/SEGModules.git'
```

^ Specifies explicit dependencies
^ Different types of requirements, including external sources

---

### How it Works

---

### Encapsulation

- SpecificationProvider
- UI

^ SP translates client-side domain knowledge into answers for Molinillo
^ UI prints out pretty dots every second

---

### The Algorithm

- Constrainst Solving Problem
- Backtracking
- Forward Checking

^ forward checking = stop as soon as you hit a dead end (dont color in the rest of the picture)
^ Hard CSP because the sets of constraints are dynamic -> no easy graph theory answer ðŸ˜ž

---

### Stack of __States__
### And :loop:

---

### Sort Dependencies
### Handle One
### Create a Possibility State

---

### See if it works

---

### Yes *=>* move on
### No *=>* unwind for conflict

---

### [fit] Stop when all requirements are activated

---

### [fit] Raise when there are no possibible states left

---

## Examples

### __After:__

it *just works* :grinning:

^ This means we can let computers do what they're best at
^ Less need for manual intervention
